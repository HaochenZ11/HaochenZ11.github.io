For the Embodied AI Safety course I am taking in Spring 2025, my project is titled **Automatically Generating Semantic Safety Representations for Indoor Navigation**. The key idea is to use foundation models such as VLMs and LLMs with tool calling to bridge the gap between higher-level safety constraints and safety-aware reasoning with structured safety representations such as backwards reachable tubes (BRTs).

Final results coming soon!
