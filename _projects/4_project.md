For the Engineering Science ECE major capstone project, our team worked with a stakeholder at TD Bank to develop a web tool for quickly gauging employee wellbeing with a focus on usability, data security, and privacy. We developed a quick visual and interactive survey widget with a d3 and React front-end, and ASP.Net and Microsoft Azure back-end to act as a "litmus test" for HR.
