For the Learning for 3D Vision course I'm currently taking in Spring 2025, my project is titled **Language-Guided Object Placement in 3D Indoor Scenes Using Learned Diffusion Priors**. The project is motivated by online furniture placement tools and the key idea is a training-free pipeline that inserts a 3D object into any 3D scene using a natural language instruction for where to place it.

Final results coming soon!
