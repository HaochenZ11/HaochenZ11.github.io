I took a course called Spacecraft Design-Build-Fly Lab last semester where the class worked together to design a CubeSat for launch that would be capable of visual-inertial determination of orbit. I was on the ML subteam where I worked on a vision pipeline for localizing where the satellite was above Earth.
