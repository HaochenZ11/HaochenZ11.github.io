Hi! I'm Haochen and I'm a 1st-year PhD student in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University's [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I work with Prof. [Yonatan Bisk](https://talkingtorobots.com/yonatanbisk.html) in the [CLAW Lab](https://talkingtorobots.com/). My main research interests are in **semantic reasoning for VLAs, linguistic generalization, and policy steering towards safe action spaces**.

I recently completed my MS in Robotics as part of the Zhang Lab and AirLab, advised by Prof. [Ji Zhang](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~zhangji/) and Prof. [Wenshan Wang](http://www.wangwenshan.com/). There, I conducted research in 3D semantic scene understanding, and vision-language navigation.

Previously, I obtained my BASc in Engineering Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I completed my undergrad thesis under Prof. [Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/) in natural language preference retrieval at the [D3M Lab](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/). I also obtained a Minor in Artificial Intelligence and Certificate in Engineering Leadership.
