Hi! I'm Haochen and I'm a second year Master's of Science in Robotics student at Carnegie Mellon University's [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I conduct research as part of the Field Robotics Center under the supervision of Dr. [Ji Zhang](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~zhangji/) and Dr. [Wenshan Wang](http://www.wangwenshan.com/). My main research interests are in 3D semantic scene understanding, vision-language navigation, and interactive navigation agents. 

Previously, I obtained my BASc in Engineering Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I completed my undergrad thesis under Dr. [Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/) in natural language preference retrieval at the [Data-Driven Decision Making (D3M) Lab](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/). I also obtained a Minor in Artificial Intelligence and Certificate in Engineering Leadership.
