I attended IROS 2025 in Hangzhou, China were I presented our [SORT3D](https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D) paper and hosted the [2nd AI Meets Autonomy workshop](https://www.ai-meets-autonomy.com/iros-workshop-2025-upcoming)! Results and winners from our 2025 [CMU Vision-Language-Autonomy Challenge](https://www.ai-meets-autonomy.com/cmu-vla-challenge) were also presented.
